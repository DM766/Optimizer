## Outline
Users can utilize the YouTube API in order to find the highest like-to-dislike ratio video available on the platform (Up to a reach of 15 videos).
The goal is to allow users to quickly find the most optimal YouTube video for whatever it is they're looking for, an important quality after YouTube dislikes have been removed from the platform.

Users can create custom playlists of optimal videos. They're returned with a generated code responsible for sharing the playlist to other users.
The code can be used to import and display playlists on the app.
